# Linux basic commands to be familiar with O.S
- Navigate files and directories
- Manage files (cp, mv, rm)
- View files (cat, less)
- Permissions (chmod, chown)
- System info commands



## 1.Concept: Linux Filesystem
- Navigating Files & Directories
- Linux uses a hierarchical directory structure, starting from root (/).
- Everything starts at / (root directory).

	## Key commands :
	
	### 1.1 pwd — Print Working Directory - Shows your current directory location.
	- cmd:pwd
	- Example output:/home/user/projects

	### 1.2 ls — List Directory Contents
	- Lists files and directories.
		
		- Common Usages:
			- ls          # list names only
			- ls -l       # list with details (permissions, size, date)
			- ls -a       # show hidden files (files starting with .)
			- ls -lh      # human-readable sizes
			- ls -ltr     # sort by time, newest at bottom

	### 1.3 cd — Change Directory
	- Navigate to a different directory.
		
		- Usage examples:
			- cd /var/log
			- cd ~        # go to home
			- cd ..       # go up one directory
			- cd ../..    # go up two levels
			- cd -        # go to previous directory
	
	### 1.4 tree (optional)
	- Shows directory tree.
	- tree /etc
	
## 2.Managing Files (cp, mv, rm):		These commands manipulate files and directories.
	
	## 2.1 touch — Create Empty File
		- touch file.txt
	
	## 2.2 mkdir — Create Directory
		- mkdir myfolder
		- mkdir -p devops/scripts/logs    # create nested folders
	
	## 2.3 cp — Copy Files

		- Basic copy:
		- cp file1.txt file2.txt
	
		- Copy folder recursively:
		- cp -r folder1 folder2
	
		- Copy with verbose output:
		- cp -v file.txt /backup/
	
	## 2.4 mv — Move or Rename
		- Move:
		- mv file.txt /home/user/docs/
	
		- Rename:
		- mv oldname.txt newname.txt
	
		- rm — Remove (Delete)
		- Delete file:
		- rm file.txt
	
		- Delete folder:
		- rm -r foldername
	
		- Force delete (dangerous):
		- rm -rf /
		- NEVER RUN THIS — it wipes your system.
		
## 3.Viewing Files (cat, less, head, tail)
	## 3.1 cat — Display File Content
		- cat file.txt
	
		- With line numbers:
		- cat -n file.txt
	
	## 3.2 less — View Large Files (Best for logs)
		- less /var/log/syslog
	
	
		Navigation inside less:
			- Up/Down arrows	
			- q = quit	
			- /keyword = search	
			- n = next match
	
	## 3.3 head — First Lines of File
		- head file.txt
		- head -20 file.txt  # first 20 lines
	
	## 3.4 tail — Last Lines of File
		- tail file.txt
		- tail -f /var/log/syslog   # live log monitoring
	
## 4.Permissions (chmod, chown):		Linux permissions control who can read, write, or execute a file.
	
	## 4.1 Permission Types
	
		```
			Permission	Symbol	Meaning
			==========	======	==================
			read		 r		view file content
			write		 w		modify/delete
			execute		 x		run as a program
		```
	
	## 4.2 Permission Groups
		- Linux assigns permissions for:
			- Owner
			- Group
			- Others
	
		- Run: ls -l
		- You’ll see: " -rwxr-xr--  1 user group  123 Jan 1 script.sh"
		
			```
				Breakdown:
				============
				rwx → owner
				r-x → group
				r-- → others
			```
	## 4.3 chmod — Change Permissions
		- Symbolic:
			- chmod u+x script.sh    # add execute to owner
			- chmod g-w myfile       # remove write from group
			- chmod a+r file         # give read to everyone
	
		- Numeric mode:
		
		```
			Number	Meaning		Permissions
			=======	=========	======================
			7		rwx			->READ,WRITE,EXECUTE
			6		rw-         ->READ,WRITE
			5		r-x			->READ,EXECUTE
			4		r--			->READ
		```
		- So:
		- chmod 755 script.sh
		- Means:
			- Owner: rwx    7 ---READ,WRITE,EXECUTE
			- Group: r-x    5 ---READ,EXECUTE
			- Others: r-x   5 ---READ,EXECUTE
	
	## 4.4 chown — Change Owner
		- chown user file
		- chown user:group file
	
	
		- Example: chown root:root /var/www/html
	
## 5.System Info Commands:		These commands give system-level information needed for DevOps & troubleshooting.
	## 5.1 uname — System Info
		- Shows kernel version, architecture, OS type : uname -a
	
	## 5.2 uptime — System Uptime
		- uptime
		- Also shows system load averages.
	
	## 5.3 df — Disk Usage
		- df -h
		- Shows mounted partitions and free space.
	
	## 5.4 du — Directory/File Size
		- du -sh /var/log
	
	## 5.5 top — Live Process Monitor
		- top
	
		- Alternative (better):
			- htop
	
	## 5.6 free — Memory Usage
		- free -h
	
	## 5.7 whoami — Current User
		- whoami
	
	## 5.8 id — User ID and Groups
		- id
	
	## 5.9 hostnamectl — Host Information
		- hostnamectl

## 6. Text Processing & Shell Scripting Essentials:		These commands help extract, filter, modify, and search text — essential for DevOps.

	## 6.1 grep — Search Text in Files
	- Search patterns in files (works with regex).
	
	Basic search:
	- grep "error" logfile.txt
		
	Case-insensitive:
	- grep -i "warning" logfile.txt
		
	Recursive search in directory:
	- grep -r "keyword" /var/log/
    
	Show line numbers:
	- grep -n "root" /etc/passwd
	
## 6.2 awk — Smart Text Processing
	
	Reads files line-by-line and processes fields (columns).
	Print first column:
	- awk '{print $1}' file.txt
	
	Print specific columns:
	- awk '{print $1, $3}' file.txt
	
	Filter rows:
	- awk '$3 > 50' data.txt   # print rows where 3rd column value > 50
		
	Field separator:
	- awk -F: '{print $1}' /etc/passwd   # print usernames
	
## 6.3 sed — Stream Editor (Modify Text)
	Search + replace values inside file.
	Replace first occurrence in each line:
	- sed 's/old/new/' file.txt
	
	Replace all occurrences:
	- sed 's/error/OK/g' file.txt
		
	Delete lines:
	- sed '/delete_me/d' file.txt
	
## 6.4 find — Search Files & Directories
	Locate files by name, type, size, etc.
	
	Find by name:
	- find /home -name "*.log"
		
	Find by size:
	- find /var -size +100M
		
	Delete matching files (use carefully):
	- find . -name "*.tmp" -delete
	
## 6.5 sort — Sort Text
	
	Sort alphabetically:
	- sort names.txt
		
	Sort numerically:
	- sort -n numbers.txt
		
	Reverse sort:
	- sort -r data.txt
	
## 6.6 uniq — Remove Duplicate Lines
	
	Show unique lines:
	- uniq file.txt
	
	
	Count occurrences:
	- uniq -c file.txt | sort -n
	
## 6.7 wc — Count Words, Lines, Characters
	
	Count lines:
	- wc -l file.txt
	
	
	Count words:
	- wc -w file.txt
	
	
	Show all counts:
	- wc file.txt
	
## 6.8 cut — Extract Columns by Character/Delimiter
	Cut first 10 characters:
	- cut -c 1-10 file.txt
	
	
	Cut specific field (columns) using delimiter:
	- cut -d ":" -f 1 /etc/passwd   # show usernames
	
## 6.9 xargs — Execute Commands from Output
	
	Example: delete files listed from a command:
	- find . -name "*.bak" | xargs rm -f
